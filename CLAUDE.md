# Project notes for AI coding agents

Project: **TypeDB Noodlelab Visual Explorer** (`typedb-noodlelab-visual-explorer`). Noodlelab is the owner's
umbrella name for experimental software projects.

## Who this is for
The project owner has no programming background and is learning as we go.
Explain new terms in plain English, keep steps small, and verify each step works before moving on.

## Approval gates
Stop at the end of every milestone and report what's done, what failed and what's next.
Current work: Phase B of docs/mechanical-upgrade-plan.md, in the owner's order: TypeDB integration (done,
awaiting review), then a one-day Blender exterior trial (stop for review), then mechanical systems against
the provisional dimensions in docs/design-targets.md. No commissioning or vendor contact.

## Rules
- **TypeDB is the only database** (permanent: docs/decisions/0001-typedb-sole-database.md). No other
  database, database client or browser storage for application data; `web/src/architecture.test.ts`
  enforces it. Static assets (GLB, textures, animation data) and seed files are allowed; the running app
  must get domain facts from TypeDB, and show an explicit error when TypeDB is unavailable.
- The vehicle is original and unbranded. No manufacturer names, logos or claims of endorsement.
  Never present invented specifications as real; label the vehicle as a concept.
- Component ids are stable: never rename one. `data/seed/components.yaml` (loaded into TypeDB) is where
  components are defined; `web/src/vehicle/manifest.ts` only says how each id is drawn (shape, position,
  material) and must hold no names, types or memberships. Tests keep the two id lists identical.
- Everything the app displays about a component comes from a named TypeQL query through the API; never
  fake query results or add domain data in the frontend.
- Node.js is not installed on the host: run npm, tsc and vitest inside the `noodlelab-web-dev` container
  (`docker exec noodlelab-web-dev ...`). Docker's CLI is at `~/.docker/bin/docker`.
- Ports: 5180 (web dev), 1733 (TypeDB driver), 8004 (TypeDB HTTP, for Studio). Reserved: 8092 (web).
  The API has no published port: the web dev server forwards /api to it.
  Other projects on this machine use 1729-1732, 8002-8003, 8090-8091. Bind everything to 127.0.0.1.
- TypeDB is 3.x only (3.14.1). See the TypeDB notes in ../typedb-cyber-intel/CLAUDE.md; log TypeDB
  friction in ../typedb-cyber-intel/notes/typedb-feedback.md.

## TypeDB and the semantic API
- Services (compose.yaml): `typedb` (noodlelab-typedb, data in the noodlelab-typedb-data volume), `seed`
  (one-off, creates the `vehicle` database if missing), `api` (noodlelab-api, Python, reloads on code change).
- Recreate the database after changing schema/ or data/seed/:
  `docker compose run --rm --no-deps seed python -m explorer.seed --replace`.
  Then regenerate the explosion grouping (an animation asset, checked against TypeDB by a test):
  `docker compose run --rm --no-deps api python -m explorer.animation > web/src/vehicle/explosion-groups.json`.
- Code: `schema/schema.tql` + `schema/functions.tql`; `data/seed/*.yaml` (placeholders `<c>`, `<a>`, `<s>`);
  `api/explorer/seed.py` (validate, one insert, count check), `queries.py` (the only queries the API runs),
  `api.py` (GET-only endpoints; 503 typedb-unavailable, 500 query-failed, 404, 422), `animation.py`.
- Web side: `web/src/semantic/api.ts` (client), `web/src/ui/ComponentPanel.tsx`, `web/src/ui/focus.ts`
  (perspectives: highlighted ids come from TypeDB answers).
- Explorer (web/src/ui/Explore.tsx): Systems, Assemblies, Types, Questions; named questions live in
  api/explorer/questions.py. Review screenshots and frame timing in a separate headless Chrome:
  `uv run --with websocket-client python -I scripts/browser/review.py` (and `perf.py`).
- TypeDB 3.14.1 planner bug QPL1: avoid `{ $x is $s; } or { <relation binding $x> };` (see queries.system; write-up and repro in docs/typedb-issues/).

## Git workflow (permanent)
Every piece of work follows this loop:
1. Complete one meaningful, clearly scoped step.
2. Run the checks (needs `docker compose up -d`):
   - web: `docker exec noodlelab-web-dev sh -c "npx tsc -p . && npx vitest run && npx vite build"`
   - API and TypeDB: `docker exec noodlelab-api python -m pytest -q` (uses disposable `vehicle-test-*` databases)
   - web against the live API: `docker exec -e TYPEDB_INTEGRATION=1 noodlelab-web-dev npx vitest run src/semantic`
3. Commit with a conventional commit message: `type(scope): imperative summary`, where type is one of
   feat, fix, docs, test, refactor, perf, build, chore (e.g. `feat(typedb): add component schema`).
   Then a body saying what changed and why, ending with the co-author line.
4. Push the commit to GitHub.
5. Report the commit hash and the check results. Only call a push successful after confirming it
   (`git ls-remote origin` shows the same hash).

Branches:
- `main` holds reviewed, working states only; every commit on it passes the checks.
- In-progress and experimental work lives on a feature branch (`feature/<milestone>-<topic>`, e.g.
  `feature/m2.2-mechanical`). Merge into `main` only after the owner approves (normally at a phase review).

Also:
- Never commit secrets (`.env`) or review screenshots (`web/shots/`).
- Generated 3D assets (`web/public/assets/*.glb`) are committed because the app needs them (no Git LFS
  here); keep them compressed and regenerate rather than hand-edit.
- Remote: **public** GitHub repository https://github.com/Calhem/typedb-noodlelab-visual-explorer (the owner
  chose to keep it public, so never commit anything confidential). There is no `gh` CLI: use the GitHub
  website in the browser pane; pushes use the macOS keychain credential helper.

## Blender pipeline (approved for mechanical systems; full rebuild follows docs/mechanical-upgrade-plan.md once approved)
- `blender/` holds Python scripts that model parts with Blender's `bpy` (5.2.3, isolated uv env in
  `blender/.venv`; it runs on the Mac, not Docker: there is no Linux ARM wheel). Rebuild the corner with
  `uv run --project blender python -I blender/corner.py` → `web/public/assets/corner-fr.glb`.
- Every top-level GLB node is named by a manifest component id; `web/src/scene/assets.test.ts` checks it.
  Material names in Blender are roles matched by `web/src/vehicle/studioMaterials.ts`.
- `import bpy` must come before `import bmesh` / `mathutils`.
- Comparison switches: `?corner=procedural` (old corner), `?fx=off` (no ambient occlusion / effects).
- `blender/exterior_trial.py`: the time-boxed exterior trial (scripted subdivision body, renders in Blender to
  web/shots/exterior-trial-*.png). Not used by the app; see docs/exterior-trial/README.md.

## Checking visuals in the Claude browser pane
The pane throttles animation when it is in the background, and screenshots can lag one frame.
In development the app installs helpers (`web/src/scene/devtools.ts`): `window.__vx` (React Three Fiber
state), `window.__vxProgress`, and `await __shot(progress, turntableAngle?, cameraPolarAngle?)`, which
renders a settled frame. Call `__shot` twice before a screenshot. Click "Explore the vehicle" first.
Emulated large viewports can freeze the pane; instead keep the pane's own size and call
`__size(1440, 900, 1.5)` to render at a fixed resolution, `__focus(p, ids, azimuth, elevation, distance, only?)`
for repeatable close-ups, and `await __save(name)` to write web/shots/<name>.jpg (git-ignored, includes the tier's effects), and
`__select(id)` to select a part (opens the TypeDB panel),
`await __perf()` for the checkpoint benchmark (frame time, triangles, draw calls; noisy in the pane).
